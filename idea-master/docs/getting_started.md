#Getting Started with Web Development#

We will be using a web development language called PHP. In addition, you will be required to know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as these are the standards for web development and it is difficult to ignore them. The following will attempt to shed some clarity on all of these tools.

###HTML###

HTML is a markup language (not a programming language) meaning that it is not designed to handle logical programming. Its main use is to describe how a webpage will look. Think of it is a blueprint that describes how a webpage should be laid out. Every webpage on the internet, regardless of what is written in, is always compiled down to HTML. Since HTML is incapable of logical programming, we need tools such as PHP or javacript to be able to pull data, feed data, and manipulate the content of HTML. In other words, HTML is static and is incapable of changing itself without the use of other tools.

###CSS###

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used to inject styles into HTML. Its main use is to stylize an HTML webpage.

###JavaScript###

For the sake of simplicity, JavaScript in our context and in most web development is a programming language used to inject logic into HTML and to manipulate its view. A special form of JavaScript called AJAX is specifically used to manipulate HTML on the fly. Its worth noting that JavaScript has various many libraries available online. One worth checking out is JQuery as it is responsible for a large amount of effects that most modern webpages implement.

###PHP###

PHP will be our main programming language or this project. It is a server-side language and in our case will be running on something called a [LAMP stack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29). The great thing about a PHP script is that it can contain HTML inside. This means that you can essentially have logic built into the webpage. An example with the would be dynamically producing a webpage. Think of a user profile page. My user profile page is laid out exactly the same as yours yet mine contains data relative to myself and yours with data relevant to you. All that changes in this example is the data in the page. Normally, since HTML is static, we would need two seperate HTML pages for my page and yours. By using PHP, we can have one page and dynamically feed in the appropriate data. Extremely useful!
